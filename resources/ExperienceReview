Review of Our Experience

What do you wish you had done differently in design and implementation?

What was your experience like with your providers?

Our providers gave us code they admitted wasn't working and took multiple days to respond to questions,
ultimately telling us they had decided to drop the class. Despite this, they were professional, courteous,
and apologetic that they had given their code to us in such a state. It definitely wasn't a great experience,
but we believe it was a good experience to have in recognizing and understanding that clients/providers
are not always going to be easy to deal with and that meeting and handling the expectations of various
stakeholders is a large part of software development.
